## S&P: Market Sentiment effect on Cryptocurrencies Project (by MsBA students from Columbia)
This project is cooperated by S&amp;P Global and Columbia IEOR Deparment.
This project studies the effect of market sentiment indices on cryptocurrency return and volatility. The project contains major code for data processing, historical pattern exploratory analysis, causality test, machine learning, and deep learning.

# Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:

- data processing: 
'data_processing.py': This code processes the raw market sentiment data and prepares it for analysis.
exploratory_analysis.ipynb: This notebook explores the historical patterns of cryptocurrency return and volatility.
causality_test.ipynb: This notebook performs causality tests to investigate the relationship between market sentiment indices and cryptocurrency return and volatility.
machine_learning.ipynb: This notebook uses machine learning algorithms to predict cryptocurrency return and volatility based on market sentiment indices.
deep_learning.ipynb: This notebook uses deep learning models to predict cryptocurrency return and volatility based on market sentiment indices.

# Installation and Setup
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:
numpy
pandas
